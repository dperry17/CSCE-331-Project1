           <p>
            Hi there! My name is Darin Peries, and I am a Junior computer engineering 
            major at Texas A&M. My hobbies are cooking, playing soccer, and
            working out. I have interned at companies such as Ansys and HPE, and 
            I have interests in distributed systems and concurrency. Please feel
            free to look around while you are here!
