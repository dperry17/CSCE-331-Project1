            <p>I helped pack meal bags and organize donated food into categories for storage.
                Volunteering at the Houston Food Bank was an incredible opportunity for me to

            <h3>Houston Marathon</h3>
            <p>
                The Houston Marathon is an annual event held around every January. It takes hundereds of
                volunteers to organize and make sure the event runs smoothly. I was in charge of handeling bag storage, where I had to sort people belongings
                to ensure that they are easily retrieved once the event ends. <a href="https://www.chevronhoustonmarathon.com/">Chevron Houston Marathon</a>.
